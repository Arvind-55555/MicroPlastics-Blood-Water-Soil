QUICK FIX: Push Code to GitHub

The repository is now configured to use HTTPS instead of SSH.

TO PUSH NOW:

Option 1: Interactive (Recommended)
------------------------------------
Run: bash push_to_github.sh

When prompted for credentials:
  Username: Arvind-55555
  Password: [Use Personal Access Token - see below]

Option 2: Manual
---------------
git push -u origin main

Then enter:
  Username: Arvind-55555
  Password: [Your Personal Access Token]

GENERATE PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "MicroPlastics Project"
4. Select scope: ✅ repo (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. COPY THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY (you won't see it again)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

STORE CREDENTIALS (Optional - to avoid entering each time):
git config --global credential.helper store
# Then push once, enter credentials, they'll be saved

ALTERNATIVE: Use SSH (if you want to set up new SSH keys)
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Generate SSH key: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
2. Add to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
3. Switch remote: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Arvind-55555/MicroPlastics-Blood-Water-Soil.git

See GIT_AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions.
